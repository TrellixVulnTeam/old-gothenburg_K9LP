# Audio Tour Guide Over Gothenburg

Wander around Gothenburg and travel back in time to 1931. The facts are read by [Jenny Ringdal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenny-ringdal-264b3390/) and the information about each of the places in the app is from a guidebook published in 1931.

### Some extra info

Created from the original Create React App. An extension of the tool that aims to bring the standards I feel are neccessary for development while still maintaining the ability to work as much as possible without needing to eject the project.

All documentation from the original project follows below.

The project structure is based on [How To Better Organize Your React Applications](https://medium.com/@alexmngn/how-to-better-organize-your-react-applications-2fd3ea1920f1).
